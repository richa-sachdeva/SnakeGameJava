README : Snake Game

The code files represent the classic Snake game implemented using Java.

Game right now, is pretty thin version of the game, with no Score board, counter, or to restart functionality.

But that all will be implemented with the next iteration.

The first prototype was to ensure that all basic functions like snake moving, food reappearing and game stopping on encountering an obstacle are working pretty accurately.

In the next iteration, along with above mentioned features, I would like to make the game use dynamic difficulty adjustment, so that snake slows down, or increases speed depending on how player is playing, and this is the final aim which I want to achieve with this game.
